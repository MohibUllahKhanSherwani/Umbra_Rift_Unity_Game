# UmbraRift

UmbraRift is a Unity 3D platformer built around a **dual-realm dimension swap mechanic**, where the player transitions between the **Physical** and **Spiritual** realms to navigate environments, collect items, and defeat enemies.

The project focuses on **gameplay mechanics**, **visibility-based interaction**, and **progressive level design**, rather than narrative or production-level polish.

---

## Project Context

This game was developed as a **semester project** for a **Game Development course**, using **Unity 3D** as the primary engine.

---

## Core Concept

The game world exists in two overlapping realms:

- **Physical Realm**  
  The default world state with limited interaction.

- **Spiritual Realm**  
  An alternate dimension that reveals hidden paths, collectibles, and enemies.

The player can switch between realms in real time to solve traversal and combat challenges.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Realm Switching**
  - Toggle between Physical and Spiritual realms using a key-based input.
  - Objects and enemies change visibility and interactivity based on the active realm.

- **Platforming**
  - Precision-based jumping and movement challenges.
  - Realm-specific platforms and traversal paths.

- **Combat**
  - Enemies are partially visible in the Physical realm.
  - Enemies become fully visible and damageable in the Spiritual realm.
  - Player attacks using slow-moving projectile orbs.

- **Enemy Waves and Boss**
  - Clearing the initial enemy group spawns a portal.
  - The portal spawns enemies at fixed intervals.
  - A boss enemy appears after sustained combat.
